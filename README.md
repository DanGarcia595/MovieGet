# MovieGet

I made a thing! It downloads movies from YTS. 

The Powershell Script needs your help to work though.

This is what you do:
* Clone the repo (Or get the zip if you hate technology)
* Extract if its zipped
* Open the folder
* Right-Click the shortcut (That thing with the little film reel icon on it, grandma)
* Choose Properties
* Under Target: Make sure it says "Powershell.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\MovieGet.ps1"
* Hit ok and double click the icon

BTW, you need a torrent client (duh?)

Pin this to task bar because you like movies.
