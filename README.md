# MovieGet v0.2

I made a thing! It downloads movie torrents from YTS. 

Personally, I'm lazy and I like decent quality movies quickly.

The Powershell Script needs your help to work though.

This is what you do:
* Clone the repo (or get the zip)
* Extract the repo if its zipped
* Open the folder
* Right-Click the shortcut (It looks like an movie reel)
* Choose Properties
* Under Target: Make sure it says "Powershell.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\MovieGet.ps1"
* Hit ok and double click the icon

This script will only download torrent files and open them as if you double clicked them. 

You will need appropriate torrenting software for this to work.

Pin this to task bar or desktop if you want to use this again.
